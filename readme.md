## Design goals: ##
Cornellforum has a few loose design goals:

 - Freedom for Cornellians to say whatever is on their minds
 - Completely anonymous content but account required to post (no captchas)
 - Minimal user friction and maximum user enjoyment
 - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
 - Responsive, mobile-friendly site design
 - Don't overburden the user with features
 - High quality, student-produced code
 - Open source and community-maintained
 - Never show ads, ever
 - Never be taken too seriously

 - Laravel 4.2.x and PHP 5.4+
